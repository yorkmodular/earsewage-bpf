**IMPORTANT: This module is only available as a PCB for the forseeable future - panel fabrication files can be found here. 
If you're having trouble getting a panel made, let me know and I shall endeavour to point you in the right direction.**

Something for the noise-mongers to assault their ears with - the 2HP bandpass filter is quite capable of taking a signal and 
crushing it into oblivion, with the added potential of being able to add some shrieky feedback too. Here's four of them, 
connected in parallel, so you can torture your signals in different frequency bands.

Think of it as a really, really screwed-up equaliser.

The four filters are independent of each other, so you can configure them pretty much how you like - the BOM lists 'typical' values, 
but if you can to change these around there's nothing to stop you doing so; you can calculate filter responses using the calculator 
on the [Okawa-Denshi](http://sim.okawa-denshi.jp/en/OPtazyuBakeisan.htm) site. The filter capacitors on each channel don't have to 
be the same value - there's nothing to stop you mixing and matching; I keep the values the same because it's convenient and makes 
building easier.

If you want to get freaky with routing and whatnot, there are test pads on the back side of the board for the filter inputs and outputs.

The build is relatively straightforward - there are no wilfully strange parts and components are 100% through-hole (ie. no 
surface mount). When complete, the board will fit behind a 14HP panel. Design files are provided for the Schaeffer AG Front Panel Designer
program as well as AutoCAD DXF files which can be used for laser-cutters etc.
